# Ware2Compare

## Objective
    - First, to have a program that returns a list of all movies from a particular actor      
    - Second, to be able to compare the number of movies between two actors and tell you which actor has more movies

## Instructions
This program uses axios, prompt and dotenv 

```js
const axios = require("axios");
const prompt = require("prompt");
require("dotenv").config()
```

Therefore these packages will need to be downloaded as they are required

```bash
npm install axious
npm install prompt
npm install dotent
```

Once you have the neccesary packages downloaded go ahead and run the program!

```bash
node ware2compare.js
```

## Options
You will be given three options of what you want to do. You will be prompted to choose if you would like:

```bash
1 - See a list of your favorite actors movies 
2 - Compare two of your favorite actors and see who has been in the most movies
3 - Exit
What would you like to do?:
